# Python-auth-secure-client-server-chat
Mini project in Python: Client-server chat system with login, cussword detection, and contact info restriction.

# Secure Client-Server Chat in Python 🛡️
A beginner-friendly Python project that builds a simple chat system using socket programming. It allows a client and server to chat after login, with features like bad word filtering and blocking contact info sharing (email/phone).

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 3
- `socket` module for networking
- `re` module for regular expressions (filtering)

## 🚀 How to Run the Project
> ✅ Make sure Python 3 is installed on your computer.

### 1. Open a terminal and start the server:
python server.py

### 2. Open another terminal and run the client:
python client.py

## 🔐 Login Credentials
- **Username**: admin123  
- **Password**: pass123  

## ⚠️ Limitations / Future Scope
- Only one client can connect at a time  
- No password encryption  
- No database used yet  
- Could be improved with GUI or multi-client support
